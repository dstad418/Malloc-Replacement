g-zipped file to Canvas
	No .o, executables, revision control or editor files



ALL IN VIKALLOC.C:
	vikalloc()
	vikfree()
	vikcalloc()
	vikrealloc()
	vikstrdup()


NO MALLOC!!!
	Only sbrk and brk


DLL to manage memory


main() in a different file


sbrk() - requests more memory
	call with min_sbrk_size bytes
		defined in vikalloc.c

	Use smallest multiple of min_sbrk_size that will hold the bytes called by user
	+ any overhead to mng heap

vikalloc 
	- has one brk and 1 srbk


Makefile to build the project!
